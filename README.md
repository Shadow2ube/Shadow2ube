Imagine a sandwich, but the bread is sand and the inside is memory leaks. That's my life
- I do programming, I guess.
- I know my way around Java enough to say I'm "*good*"
- I know C++ well, as well as C
- I know Python enough
- Minecraft is fun and you know it. I sometimes make plugins for it
- play.unmined.ca is the java server (It's down rn)
